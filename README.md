# VexIA-web
Vex is an AI to talk to anyone, including lonely people.
<br>
<br>
This project is an improved version of other existing versions that are not available for countries outside of Brazil.   This system is simple **for now**, does not have neural networks and is just a logical system. <br>

The goal of this project is to one day have an AI capable of talking normally to a person, without errors or with minimal errors and who knows... be a conscious AI
