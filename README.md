# VexIA-web
Vex is an AI to talk to anyone, including lonely people.  This project is an improved version of other existing versions that are not available for countries outside of Brazil.   This system is simple **for now**, does not have neural networks and is just a logical system. The project is open source and licensed with MIT LICENSE to receive future contributions and improvements from the community, the icons under CC-BY-NC 2.0 license, check out vex's reactions.  The goal of this project is to one day have an AI capable of talking normally to a person, without errors or with minimal errors and who knows... be a conscious AI
